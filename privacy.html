        <h4 id="t-advanced-license">6.2 Advanced License</h4>
        <p>An Advanced License allows Licensee to use and further develop the Software freely within the frames of 10 (ten) Domains. The Advanced License does not allow Licensee to use the Software in SaaS applications. Licensee can use the Software freely on his own server. Licensee can use the Software on Licensee's customers servers with the condition that the Software will not be accessed or used by other Developers outside of Licensee's company. Otherwise, Licensee must have an OEM License or Licensee's customers must buy a license that fits their needs. The Advanced License includes the unminified source code and twelve (12) months of technical support starting with the purchase date. Licensee has to generate manually separate Activation Keys for each Domain where the Software is used.</p>

If the License Fee for the License Type owned by Licensee has changed, the upgrade will be calculated using the License Fee paid by Licensee, and not using the new License Fee. The support period start date will not be affected by the license upgrade, and it will remain the same with the first purchase date.</p>
